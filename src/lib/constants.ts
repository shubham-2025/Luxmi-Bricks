export const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is the minimum order quantity (MOQ) for delivery?",
    answer: "Our standard minimum order quantity for truck deliveries within Prayagraj is 5,000 bricks. For smaller self-loaded pick-up requests, customers can directly visit our physical bhatta near Jhusi, Prayagraj."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you deliver to districts outside Prayagraj?",
    answer: "Yes, we regularly dispatch cargo carriers to surrounding Purvanchal districts including Varanasi, Lucknow, Jaunpur, Mirzapur, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Ayodhya, and Sultanpur."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the key difference between Red Clay and Fly Ash bricks?",
    answer: "Red Clay bricks are traditional kiln-fired blocks made from fertile river soils, excellent for core load load-bearing structures. Fly Ash bricks are eco-friendly industrial ash-concrete formulations that offer supreme sizing consistency, lowering mortar plaster usage by up to 15-20%."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a bulk delivery dispatch take?",
    answer: "For standard stocks, deliveries dispatch within 24 to 48 hours of order confirmation and advance release. Custom-sized clay mold requests require additional lead time based on dry-time and kiln schedule cycles."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I inspect the factory or bhatta before placing my commercial order?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We encourage engineers, architects, and site supervisors to visit our headquarters at Banaras Road, Garapur, Jhusi, Prayagraj for a complete layout tour and to witness our crushing strength lab tests."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide proper commercial GST invoices?",
    answer: "Yes, Luxmi Brick Field is a fully registered tax-paying corporate manufacturer. Every delivery dispatch is accompanied by an electronic transit E-Way bill and a valid 12% standard GST invoice."
  },
  {
    question: "What secure payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We support direct RTGS/NEFT bank transfers, UPI payments, business checks, and cash collections at our factory register counter."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your bricks certified by national standards?",
    answer: "Yes, our Class-I structural Red Clay and Fly Ash bricks are manufactured under Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) parameters, matching premium compressive strengths."
